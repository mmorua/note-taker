## Testing

Tests have been written in the `__tests__` folder to check if an object has the required properties using the `inputCheck.js` file located in the `utils` folder. If the object does have the required properties, `inputCheck()` returns null. If the object's property is blank or doesn't exist, an error is added to errors array. To run the tests, first make sure Jest is installed by checking the `package.json` file. If Jest is not installed, refer to the Installation section above. After confirming that Jest is installed, type `npm test` into the command line and a series of tests will be returned.
